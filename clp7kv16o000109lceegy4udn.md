**OVERVIEW**

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the data transmission protocol that powers the World Wide Web (WWW). It is a stateless, layered protocol used to transport hypertext texts and other Internet resources. HTTP is a request-response protocol, which implies that a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with a response.

**What is an HTTP?**

An HTTP request action is a message sent by a client (usually a web browser or application) to a web server requesting some action or data. is the foundation of any data exchange on the internet, and it’s a request-response-based protocol. It is an application that runs on the TCP/IP suite of protocols, HTTP it’s a fundamental part of how the World Wide Web works.

**How does HTTP work?**

The World Wide Web’s cornerstone for data exchange is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It functions as a request-response protocol, allowing clients (often web browsers) to ask web servers for resources and get back responses in the form of documents, images, web pages, and other types of data. This is a high-level summary of how HTTP functions:

**Customer-Server Interaction:**

A web server receives an HTTP request from a client, such as a web browser. A uniform resource locator, or URL, identifying the desired resource on the server is usually included in the request. HTTP REQUEST HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request actions are what the client devices send to the server to request the information required to load the webpage. The request provides the server with the desired information it needs to tailor its response to the client device. HTTP requests are made up of the start line, the HTTP request header, and the HTTP request body. Every HTTP request starts with a request/Starline, one that consists of the HTTP request method, the requested resources, and the HTTP version used.

**HTTP REQUEST METHOD:**

The desired action is indicated by the request method included in the HTTP request. Typical HTTP methods consist of:

1. *GET:* A method for getting resources or data from the server.
    
2. POST: A protocol to send or submit data to the server for processing.
    
3. PUT: A server resource that has already been created and updated.
    
4. PATCH: Unlike the PUT method, PATCH replaces or modifies part of the data on the web server.
    
5. DELETE: This command asks for a resource to be taken down on the web server.
    

**HTTP RESPONSE STATUS**

The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request message is the response sent to the client, often from the web server. It’s the service reply to the HTTP request made by the client devices. The information contained in the HTTP response is made to suit the context the server received from the request. The server sends an HTTP response to the client. The response includes a status code that indicates the result of the request; if the request is successful, if there was an error, or if the request has been redirected. The status code is usually three (3) digits ranging from 100 to 599 each indicating different status of the request.

* 2xx Successful: indicates that the request was successful, and the requested resource is included in the response.
    
* 3xx Redirection: indicates that further action is required by the client as the request has been moved or redirected to another website.
    
* 4xx Not Found: indicates that the requested resource was not found on the server.
    
* 5xx Internal Server Error: indicates that an error occurred on the server while processing the request.
    

The server processes the request data and sends back an HTTP response, which contains the results of the required action. This client-server communication is how web browsers retrieve web pages and how applications interact with web services and AIPs.

**HTTP and HTTPS**

HTTPS (HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURE) is the secure HTTP. It works the same as HTTP but encrypts the data it sends from the web. browser to the web server and also encrypts the resources from the web server to the browser.

**Conclusion**

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (WWW). It is a fundamental protocol that underpins the vast network of information and communication on the Internet. Its simplicity, flexibility, and adaptability have made it the cornerstone of web technology, enabling the exchange of data and interactions that power the digital world.
